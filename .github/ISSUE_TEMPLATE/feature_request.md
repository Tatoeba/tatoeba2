**Story** or **Context**
Tell us a story. How did you came up with that idea? What made you think about it?

*Example:*
> On the Wall, I often find some discussions very interesting, but I don't feel like commenting because I have nothing to say. One recent example is [this one](https://tatoeba.org/eng/sentences/show/8619497).
> But I happen upon something really interesting like this quite often. Sometimes I stumble upon an interesting question that is not answered yet, and I want to wait for the answer too. I just don't want to miss it, and I believe I mostly miss them.
> For questions, especially if the question has been there for years, I sometimes add something like "I've got this question too" - it's not really constructive, but this way it gets a higher chance of being noticed, and it also "subscribes" me to that thread.
> But I often don't have anything to contribute, but still interested in the discussion and don't want to miss anything, taking into account some discussions are happening at the speed of one post per month or something.

**Idea**
Describe your idea. If possible, include images so that it's easier for us to picture it.
*Example: I want to have a button to "subscribe" to the thread. This way I get a notification by email every time somebody posts a new message in that thread.*

**Title**
Finally, please *focus on the problem* that your feature request is solving. Whatâ€™s wrong with how things are now? Wrap it up into one sentence and use it as title for the issue.
*Example: Can't subscribe to a discussion without posting an unnecessary comment*
