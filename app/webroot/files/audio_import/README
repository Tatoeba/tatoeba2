This folder was created to test the audio on dev environments.
Itâ€™s a temporary folder to import new audio recordings.

How to import audio recordings :

1. Make sure the webserver has read and write access to this folder.
2. Put your audio recordings here, named after the ID of the sentence: <id>.mp3
   (e.g. recording for sentence #7276361 should be named 7276361.mp3).
3. Log in as admin and go to /audio/import to import them
   (e.g. http://localhost:8080/eng/audio/import ).
