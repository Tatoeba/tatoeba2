# This is for developpers of TatoVM

This guide is for developpers of TatoVM. If you want to install a local instance of Tatoeba, please refer to the file `README.tatovm.md` instead.

## Requirements

Here are the basic requirements of the machine youâ€™re using TatoVM from.

* GNU/Linux or MacOS
* Git
* Ansible 2.4 or later (also available on pip: `pip install ansible`)
* VirtualBox 4.0 or later, which can be installed with a package manager or with the help of [generic binaries](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
* Vagrant 1.7 or later

## Building a local VM

- Install the requirements above.

- Clone the repository and go to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tatoeba/tatoeba2
cd tatoeba2
```

- If you need to use a proxy, follow the instructions in `README.proxy.md`.

- Run these commands to install everything. Please be patient, it takes a while for vagrant to download the ~300MB box on your machine and then to provision it using ansible.

```bash
BUILD=1 vagrant box update
BUILD=1 vagrant up
```

## Post-provisioning tasks

You may want to perform certain tasks or steps independently without having to re-provision the whole machine again. To do that you can use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i .vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key ansible/vagrant.yml --tag <tag>
```

where `<tag>` is one of the tags present in the file `ansible/tatoeba.tasks.yml`. You can also use `--skip-tag` to run all the tasks *but* one in particular. Since the command is too long and very difficult to remember, you can use the following commands to create an alias:

```bash
echo "alias tatovm-provision='ansible-playbook -i .vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key ansible/vagrant.yml'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can simply use the following command to run a particular step:

```bash
tatovm-provision --tag external_tools
```

## Publish the VM

- Export the VM into a file

```bash
vagrant package --output tatoeba.box
```

- Upload the VM

  - Log into https://app.vagrantup.com/

  - Add a new version

  - Add a new provider

    - Type `virtualbox` for the Provider field

    - Upload the exported VM

  - Release the new version
