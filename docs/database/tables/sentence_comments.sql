-- Table structure for table `sentence_comments`
--
-- This table stores the comments posted on sentences. Each comment can only be
-- associated to one sentence for now. In the future it could be useful to
-- associate a comment to several sentences. This would make more sense in case
-- a comment is made on how a translation is not very accurate or incorrect.
-- 
-- id          Id of the comment.
-- sentence_id Id of the sentence that is commented.
-- lang        Language of the comment.
-- text        Text of the comment. Using varbinary in order to support UTF-8
--               charaters encoded on 4 bytes.
-- user_id     Id of the user who posted the comment.
-- created     Date and time when the comment was posted.
-- modified    Date and time when the comment was last modified.
-- hidden      A comment is hidden when it is inappropriate.
