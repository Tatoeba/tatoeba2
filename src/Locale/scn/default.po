#. This is a simple countermeasure against spam bots trying to

#. registration page, but you won't see it because it is purposely hidden.
#. As a result, a regular user will never fill out this field. Spam bots on
#. the other hand don't know which part of the page is visible or not and are
#. likely to carelessly fill all the fields. If anything is written in that
#. hidden field, registration won't work. This strategy is called a honeypot.
#. However, visually-impaired people browsing the page using a screen reader
#. may notice the presence of the hidden field. To help them, we leave a
