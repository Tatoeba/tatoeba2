Installing Tatoeba
------------------

### Linux & Mac

If you are a Linux or Mac user, we recommend that you use [Imouto][2] to
install Tatoeba on your machine.
Simply follow the instructions in [Imouto for development][3] in the README.

If for some reason you prefer to install manually or if Imouto doesn't work 
for you, you can follow our [wiki article about installing Tatoeba][4].

### Windows

If you are a Windows user, you won't be able to use Imouto. You will have to
install everything manually. Please refer to our [wiki article about installing
Tatoeba][4].

Note that since Imouto uses VirtualBox, it will not make sense to install a VM 
on Windows and then use Imouto inside the VM. If you wish, you may set up a VM 
rather than installing Tatoeba directly on your Windows, but you will still have 
to install Tatoeba manually inside the VM.
